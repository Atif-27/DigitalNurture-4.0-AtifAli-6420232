# Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting Using Recursive Algorithms

## Overview

This exercise focuses on building a financial forecasting tool that leverages recursion to estimate future values based on past data and growth trends.

## 1. Understanding Recursive Algorithms

### What is Recursion?

Recursion is a technique in programming where a function repeatedly calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. This continues until a base condition is met, which stops the recursion.

### Key Components of Recursion:

- **Base Case:** The condition that ends the recursion.
- **Recursive Case:** The part where the function calls itself with modified arguments.

### Why Use Recursion?

Recursion helps express mathematical formulas more naturally in code. Compared to loops, recursive solutions often appear more readable and closely reflect the underlying logic of the problemâ€”especially for problems involving compound or repetitive structures.

## 4. Complexity Analysis and Optimization

### Time and Space Complexity

Our recursive forecasting function follows this complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where *n* is the number of periods  
  - Each call performs a constant-time operation.
  - Total recursive calls = number of periods.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
  - Each function call adds a new frame to the stack.
  - Stack depth increases linearly with the number of recursive calls.

### Performance Considerations

When dealing with a large number of periods (e.g., 1000+), recursion may lead to a stack overflow due to excessive memory usage.

## Optimization Strategies
Transforming the recursive logic into a loop eliminates the risk of stack overflow and improves memory efficiency.

```java
// Iterative version: O(n) time, O(1) space
for (int i = 0; i < periods; i++) {
    result *= (1 + growthRate);
}
